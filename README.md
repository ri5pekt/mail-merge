Add some changes to the code, and then commit the changes. For now, we will "Commit directly to the master branch".
Make another change to the Readme.md file on GitHub.

If you are happy with the change, add a comment that explains what you did, and click Commit changes.

And we make some changes to the README.md file. Just add a new line.

So now we check the status of the current branch.
